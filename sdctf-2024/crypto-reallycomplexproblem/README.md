## TL;DR
Modified coppersmith method that converts the complex valued matrix into a real matrix through a canonical embedding and
solve it like normal.

## Introduction, audience, and pre-requisites

This writeup, like most of my writeups, is geared towards people with an elementary understanding of Math. Additionally,
this writeup focuses on the logic behind the solution as opposed to *just* the solution.

The pre-requisites that would be nice to know before reading this are:
- The RSA encryption and decryption scheme Basic modular arithmetic Matrix algebra (vectors, linear combinations, and
- matrices) An elementary understanding of complex numbers

    Alright then. Sit tight and buckle up because we are in for a doozy!

## Challenge Overview and Inspecting the Code

The challenge performs RSA with complex integers (Gaussian Integers: $\mathbb{Z}[i]$) as opposed to regular Integers
$\mathbb{Z}$. A Complex integer is a complex number $a + bi$ such that $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$. 

Fortunately, the logic behind the algorithm, Complex-RSA (CRSA), remains fairly familiar with a few caveats:
- We say that a Gaussian integer $w$ is prime if its norm is prime.
    - "What's a norm?" In this case, consider a norm to be defined as $Re(w)^2 + Im(w)^2$. (This can be interpreted,
-   geometrically, as the square of the point's distance from the origin) Once we generate our primes `p` and `q`, the
    rest of the process is the same as regular RSA. (I'm skipping over
    details for modular exponentiation because it's not relevant to the challenge)


The second part of the challenge involves our LEAKed picture which features a terminal with output that reads the values
of `N`, `ciphertext`, and a some portion of `p`. Interestingly enough, we see about two-thirds of both the real and the
imaginary part of `p` with the rest covered by the beautiful hand-drawn raccoon

## But we're missing bits! Now what?

You're right. There is still a bit of work to do if we would like to decrypt our message. Alright, let's take a deep
breath and work step-by-step. What information do we need to retrieve the original plaintext `m`.

To decrypt a message we need `d` which is defined as `e^-1 (mod (norm(p)-1)*(norm(q)-1))`. To find `d`, we need `p` and
`q` which in turn require us to factor `N = pq`. To factorize `N`, we would need "recover" `p` from the information that
was leaked and divide `N` by `p`. 

**Oh boy.** That's a lot. All these steps are fairly straightforward with the exception of recovering `p`. So, our goal
is to recover this value.

After some painful counting and testing, There's roughly about 155 digits for both the real and imaginary parts. we have
about 85 and 87 of these digits respectively. (Okay, maybe it wasn't two-thirds...)


Retrieving these missing bits seems hard. Let's consider a simpler problem: What if this was regular RSA and we had
about 60% of p. As it turns out, someone has solved this problem before.

## A Copper sword crafted by the kingdom's finest blackSmith

Enter the Coppersmith method. In a nutshell, the method finds small integer roots of polynomials modulo a given integer.
To clarify, this means that if we have a polynomial of the form $F(x) = x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_1x + a_0$ where
$a_i \in \mathbb{Z \text{ (mod N)}}$,  and we know that there exists some integer $x_0$ such that $F(x_0) \equiv 0
\text{ (mod N)}$ and $|x_0|$ is less than $N^{\frac{1}{n}}$, we can find $x_0$. 

You might be wondering, "cool fact. What does this have to do with us?" The answer is *everything*. Let me take you
through this step-by-step. 

1. Recall that we have knowledge of `N`, the fact that `N = p * q`, and a fair chunk of `p` (let's say about
    110 digits of 155 digits). 
2. We can express `p` as follows `p = the_known_part + the_unknown_part`. Mathematically, $p = a + r$
  where a and r are the known and unknown parts of p respectively. 
    - For example if `p = 382xx`, we would express it as $p = 38200 + r$.
3. We also have that $r$ is less than $10^{45}$ since $r$ has 45 digits. Thus, we get an upper bound $R = 10^{45}$.
4. Let's create a polynomial $f(x)$ modulo $p$. We will define $f(x) = a + x$ where $a$ is a constant which represents
    the known part of $p$. 
    - In the definition of the method above, $n = 1$ (aka the degree of the polynomial we must solve)
5. Now, $f(r) = a + r = p \equiv 0 \text{ (mod p)}$. In other words, $r$ is our small ineger root $x_0$ from the
   definition above. 
6. Note, that $r$ is less than $R$ which is less than $p^{\frac{1}{1}} = p^1$ which is less than $N$.
7. YAY! This is literally what the Coppersmith method needs to work.

![oh yeah, it's all coming together](https://media1.tenor.com/m/sqYV7D2euF8AAAAC/kronk-oh-yeah-its-all-coming-together.gif)


## The Coppersmith Attack is truly one of the attacks of all time

Now that we have the pieces, let's apply the coppersmith method to find our $x_0$ ($r$). Firstly, it's good to
understand a bit of our motivation here. It is very difficult to find the roots of an integer polynomial over some
modulo N. However, it is extremely trivial (relatively) to find the roots of the same polynomial over the integers. The
method takes in our polynomial $f(x)$ performs a bit of magic and in combination with the Howgrave-Graham theorem it
converts our polynomial modulo N to a simple polynomial with the same small roots over the integers (no modulo).

### The Howgrave-Graham Theorem
Okay, so the (extremely abridged version of) Howgrave-Graham Theorem states that for a polynomial $g(x)$, if:
- $g(x_0) \equiv 0 \text{ (mod }b^k\text{)}$ for some $b, k$
- $abs(x_0) \le R$ Where R is the upper bound we discussed earlier
- The length of the coefficient vector of $g(R \cdot x)$ is small. (The coefficient vector refers to the vector containing the
    coefficients of each term in our polynomial $[a_n, a_{n-1}, ..., a_1, a_0]$.)
    - Small is once again defined as being less than some bound based on $b, k$ and the degree of $g(x)$. However, it's
        not relevant to us because we will fulfill it at the end. (Haha! this might be forshadowing)

then $g(x_0) = 0$ over the integers too. That is, $x_0$ is an integer root. 

Great! let's use this on $f(x)$. Well... we can't use it just yet because the coefficients of the polynomial $f(R\cdot x)$ are
**huge**. In particular, the constant term $a$ is the same number of digits of $p$. This fails the third condition in
the Howgrave-Graham theorem which wants a small coefficient vector. Fortunately, there's a way to fix this.

### Reducing the Size of our Massive Polynomials

At first glance, it seems difficult to do reduce the size of our coefficients. However, all we need is a small cameo
from our good old friend: linear combinations. 

Suppose I had two polynomials $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ such that $a(x_0) \equiv b(x_0) \equiv 0 \text{ (mod m)}$ for some
integers $m$ and $x_0$. Note that $a(x_0)$ doesn't neccessarily equal $b(x_0)$. Now, we have that $a(x_0) + b(x_0)
\equiv 0 \text{ (mod m)}$. Trivially, we also have that $l \cdot a(x_0) \equiv 0 \text{ mod(m)}$ for any integer $l$.
Thus, for any integers $l$ and $k$, we get $l \cdot a(x_0) + k \cdot b(x_0) \equiv 0 \text{ mod(m)}$. So

In summary, we just showed that any *integer* linear combination of two polynomials preserves (or has the same) the root
$x_0$ over our modulus $m$. 
So, this means that if we can find other polynomials which has the same root, x_0, as $f(Rx)$ (and $f(x)$) modulo $p$, then we can
craft an integer linear combination between them to reduce the size of our coefficients. (Note: this is similar to the
idea of row reductions in matrix algebra).

### A Trick to Create Unlimited Polynomials

Our long chain of dominos continues as we search for polynomials with the same root $x_0$ as $f(x)$ over our modulus p.
For convenience, I will call this set of polynomials $F$. The problem is we don't know $p$, so we can't make polynomials
like $g(x) = px^2 + 4px + p^3$ which will always be 0 for all values of $x$. (They're not particularly useful either).
Let's use some clever tricks instead. 

- Firstly, we know $N$ which is a multiple of $p$ so $g(x) = N \equiv 0 \text{ (mod p)}$ for all $x$ including $x_0$.
    Let's add it to $F$.
- Next, we have that $f(x_0) \equiv 0 \text{ (mod p)}$. We could square both sides and get: $[f(x_0)]^2 \equiv 0 \text{
    (mod p)}. Nice! Let's add $[f(Rx)]^2$ to $F$. 
- Why stop there? We can just continue raising $f(Rx)$ to various ineger powers and have the same outcome as above. We
    can thus add all the powers of $f(Rx)$ to $F$.

Now, we have a long list of polynomials to choose from. An alternative to this method would be to simply multiply $f(Rx)$
by different powers of $x$. However, the downside to this method is that we would lose our constant term in the elements
of $F$. The powers of $f(Rx)$ is much more elegant in the sense that due to the binomial theorem, we are bound to have
constant terms.

### The Magical Mysteries of the Lattice and LLL

We have a list of polynomials with the same root $x_0$ whose coefficients we seek to reduce through their integer linear
combinations. It remains to be asked: "How do we determine the most efficient integer linear combinations". It's time to
introduce Lattices and LLL.

---- 
### Introducing our New Show: DeComplexify This! 

Today, we will be learning what a Lattice and how LLL might help our little predicament. Recall that if we were working
with the Real numbers, we could simply use a matrix to reduce the size of a basis and make it orthogonal using the
gram schmidt method. However, we are working over the Integers where the same strategy cannot be used. 

Introducing the Lattice. No, not the lattice from Organic Chemistry. An n x n (integer) lattice is essenitally just like a
n x n matrix with two exceptions:
- All the elemwents in our lattice are integers
- The Span of our vectors refers to just the *integer* linear combinations. (Instead of real coefficients for matrices).

To clarify: We will exclusively be talking about integer lattices, hereby referred to as just lattices.

Like a matrix, we can put express our polynomial f(Rx) in the form of a row vector. In fact, you've already seen this
before in the form of our coefficient vectors. 

![](./assets/coefficient_vec.png)


We can create a matrix using some of our polynomials in $F$ where each row is a polynomial and each column is represents
the coefficients of a power of $x$. We can create a matrix using the polynomials $g(x) = N$, $f(Rx)$, $[f(Rx)]^2$.


![](./assets/3x3_lattice.png) 


Now that we have constructed our lattice, let me introduce the LLL algorithm (Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovász). I won't be going
over the nitty-gritty details of this algorithm and will instead treat this as a black box. This algorithm takes in a
lattice basis (Basis has the same meaning as in matrix algebra) and outputs a lattice with a more orthogonal and smaller
basis. You can read about it more in this wonderful [tutorial](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/032.pdf). A fun exercise is
justifying to yourself that our row vectors are linearly independent to each other.

---- 

Once we apply the LLL algorithm on this lattice, our rows, representing polynomials, will now have smaller coefficients.
Since the length of our coefficient vector is smaller (by definition of LLL), we can apply Howgrave-Graham's theorem in
order to find $x_0$ by finding the roots of $h(x)$ over the integers. Note that the resulting row vectors will be of the
form $h(Rx)$. We simply divide each coefficient by $R$ to retrieve $h(x)$. 

We have succesfully found $r$ (our $x_0$) and we can reconstruct $p$ by $a + r$. Victory! We solved our simpler RSA
problem. Now, to deal with something more complex. (literally)


## The Complexities of Complex Numbers

The question now is: "Can we do the same for our complex integers?" The answer is ***mostly***. While most of the
theorems extends out to the Complex Integers, LLL only operates over the regular integers. To understand how we overcome
this problem, let's first go through our solution till our roadblock.  

1. Write down `N` and the known part of `p`
```py
N = -117299665605343495500066013555546076891571528636736883265983243281045565874069282036132569271343532425435403925990694272204217691971976685920273893973797616802516331406709922157786766589075886459162920695874603236839806916925542657466542953678792969287219257233403203242858179791740250326198622797423733569670 + 617172569155876114160249979318183957086418478036314203819815011219450427773053947820677575617572314219592171759604357329173777288097332855501264419608220917546700717670558690359302077360008042395300149918398522094125315589513372914540059665197629643888216132356902179279651187843326175381385350379751159740993*I
a = 1671911043329305519973004484847472037065973037107329742284724545409541682312778072234 * 10^70 + 193097758392744599866999513352336709963617764800771451559221624428090414152709219472155 * 10^68 * I
```
2. At the same time as finding `a`, we can define our upper bound $R$ as $R_r$ and $R_i$ for the bound of the real and
   imaginary part of `r`. Since the primes will always have about 155 digits (this could be verified with a bit of
   testing/bruteforcing other limits).
3. Our $f(x) = a + x$. Instead of this, we can choose to be more verbose and write it as $a + bi + x + i \cdot x$. Here,
   we treat $i$ similar to a variable and all the coefficients (like $a$ and $b$) are real integers. 
4. We do the same process as before to generate different powers of $f((R_r + R_i \cdot i)x)$ modulo p. (refer to the
   challenge code to see how you can take the modulo under a complex number)
5. Now, we hit our roadblock of representing our polynomials as row vectors of integers. Well, we could simply double
   the columns (adding an imaginary part to each power of $x$). This looks like...
![](./assets/imaginary_vec.png)
    - one more note is that we can double our set from before by adding the imaginary multipe of $f$ such as $-i\cdot f(Rx)$
6. Construct a matrix with a lot of these row vectors and perform LLL. 
    - The reason we need a lot of polynomials has to do with the Howgrave-Graham theorem which essenitally ends up
        equating to us requiring more rows to have a greater chance of finding our root.
7. find the root of the reduced polynomial over the Complex Integers.
8. Retrieve `r` and thus find $p$
9. Use $p$ to find $q$ and then find $d$ and use $d$ to decrypt our ciphertext given by:
```
e = 65537
ciphertext = 49273345737246996726590603353583355178086800698760969592130868354337851978351471620667942269644899697191123465795949428583500297970396171368191380368221413824213319974264518589870025675552877945771766939806196622646891697942424667182133501533291103995066016684839583945343041150542055544031158418413191646229 - 258624816670939796343917171898007336047104253546023541021805133600172647188279270782668737543819875707355397458629869509819636079018227591566061982865881273727207354775997401017597055968919568730868113094991808052722711447543117755613371129719806669399182197476597667418343491111520020195254569779326204447367 * I
```

Wow, we did it! oh no... It did not work :(


## WHY DOESNT IT WORK!!

The short answer is that we need to modify our choice of polynomials because it still fails the conditions for the
Howgrave-Graham Theorem. Recall that the Howgrave theorem limits us on our choices of $b$, $k$, and the degree of the
polynomial. For the theorem, we need $f(x_0) \equiv 0 \text{ (mod }b^k\text{)}$. Previously, we just set $b^k = p$ and
called it a day. However. However, through a long series of proofs that are very well highlighted on this [blog](https://www.klwu.co/maths-in-crypto/lattice-2/#howgrave-grahams-formulation), 
this can be very inefficient and makes it such that the maximum upper bound for $R$ ends up being very small. The
maximum bound is usually defined by some relation $X \approx N^\frac{1}{c(d)}$ where $c(d)$ is a function that depends
on the degree, $d$, of our polynomial. Understanding this, our goal would be to reduce the the growth of $c(d)$ as much
as possible. We will be using two techniques to do this (from the same blog post).

---- 
### The First Technique: 

Rather than considering $b^k = p$, we could instead try $b = p$. This would ultimately help increase our upper bound (as
described in the blog if you are curious). What changes? Well, unfortunately $f(x_0) \equiv 0 \text{ (mod }p^k\text{)}$
is no longer true. However, this might actually be useful.

I will leave this as an exercise to the curious readers, but it's trivial to observe that if an integer $a$ divides $b$,
then $a^k$ divides $b^k$. Also, if $a$ divides $c$, then $a^k$ divides $c^{i}b^{k - i}$ for some $i \in \mathbb{Z}$ that
is less than $K$ and greater than zero. This implies that if we have two polynomials $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ such that $a(x_0)
\equiv b(x_0) \equiv 0 \text{ (mod m)}$ for some integer $m$, then $[a(x_0)]^i[b(x_0)]^{k - i} \equiv 0 \text{ (mod
}m^k\text{)}$. 

So, let's use the two polynomials we know are divisible by $p$ at $x_0$: $N$ and $f(Rx)$. (yes, N is a polynomial that
equates to a constant.) Now, instead of using powers of $f(x)$, we can instead add polynomials of the form
$[f(Rx)]^i[N]^{k - i}$ for each integer $i \in [0, k - 1]$ to our set $F$. 

Note that for our complex integers, whenever I add a polynomial $g(x)$ to $F$, I'm also adding its imaginary multiple
$-i\cdot g(x)$ to the set. This simply helps with the lattice reduction by giving the LLL algorithm more options to
reduce our polynomials by.

### Technique Numero Dos:

The second technique, which was discussed directly in the blog, involves multiplying $[f(Rx)]^k$ with various powers of
$x$. Recall that $[f(x_0)]^k \equiv 0 \text{ (mod }p^k\text{)}$.So, we add polynomials of the form $[N]^i[f(Rx)]^k $ for
each integer $i \in [0, k - 1]$ to our set $F$ (along with its imaginary multiples. Note that there's nothing really
stopping us from taking a different number of polynomials for the second technique, rather than $k - 1$ polynomials we
can take $5$ or $4000$. Though I'm not sure what those bounds would be.

----

## Back to business

Now that we have created a better lattice, we can finally solve our challenge. Nevermind! There's a lot of sage-specific
bugs that had to be squashed. 

*hours later*, we can finally use our script to reverse the encryption and encoding to get our flag.

## Final Thoughts

This was a really hard challenge. I spent over 30 hours straight running in circles with various techniques like complex
LLL and Algebraic LLL. However, I did not solve this challenge at the end of the CTF. In fact, this challenge went
unsolved by anyone. After discussing with the author, I realized that one of my earlier ideas of converting the complex
integers to a real matrix to do LLL was actually the intended solution. However, I didn't quite understand how to
complete the solve path which was doing a canonical embedding. An embedding is similar to what we did with using
different columns for the real and imaginary part of the powers of $x$ and using the imaginary multiples. 

I'm glad I was able to solve it regardless because it's better late than never. More importantly, I hope that this guide
can give you some understanding behind the complexities of the coppersmith method often needed for RSA challenges. In
this vein, I have another section with resources I found useful for this challenge. 

Finally, shoutout to 18lauey2 for making such a cool challenge.
